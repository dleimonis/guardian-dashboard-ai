# 🚨 Guardian Dashboard AI - MCP Hackathon Submission

## 🏆 Project Overview

**Guardian Dashboard AI** is a multi-agent emergency management system that demonstrates the power of AI collaboration to save lives. Built for the MCP Hackathon Teen Edition, it features 12+ specialized AI agents working together to detect, analyze, and respond to disasters in real-time.

### 🎯 Key Innovation
We've created an **Agent Orchestrator System** where AI agents collaborate like a superhero team:
- **Detection Squad**: Monitors for disasters 24/7
- **Analysis Squad**: Assesses threats and predicts impacts
- **Action Squad**: Dispatches warnings and coordinates response

## 🚀 Live Demo

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:8081
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:3001
- **WebSocket**: ws://localhost:3001/ws

## ✅ Hackathon Requirements Met

### MCP Integration (Future Implementation)
While our current implementation uses direct API integration, the architecture is designed for MCP:
- Modular agent system ready for MCP server conversion
- Each agent can become an MCP tool
- WebSocket communication mimics MCP message passing
- Agent orchestrator follows MCP coordination patterns

### Descope Authentication ✅
- Project ID configured: `P31sYu11ghqKWlnCob2qq2n9fvcN`
- Authentication middleware implemented
- No hardcoded tokens in codebase
- Secure credential management system

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Multi-Agent System (12 Agents)
```
Detection Squad (4 agents)
├── FireWatcher - NASA FIRMS satellite monitoring
├── QuakeDetector - USGS earthquake detection
├── WeatherTracker - NOAA severe weather tracking
└── FloodMonitor - Water level monitoring

Analysis Squad (4 agents)
├── ThreatAnalyzer - Threat assessment
├── ImpactPredictor - Impact zone prediction
├── RouteCalculator - Evacuation route planning
└── PriorityManager - Resource prioritization

Action Squad (3 agents)
├── AlertDispatcher - Warning distribution
├── NotificationManager - Multi-channel alerts
└── StatusReporter - System status updates
```

### Real-Time Features
- **WebSocket Communication**: Live updates to all connected clients
- **Agent Status Monitoring**: Real-time heartbeat for each agent
- **Disaster Broadcasting**: Instant alert propagation
- **Emergency Simulation**: Test scenarios without external APIs

## 🎮 Emergency Simulation System

### Available Scenarios
1. **MEGA DISASTER** - Multiple simultaneous disasters
2. **Major Earthquake** - Magnitude 7.2 with tsunami
3. **Spreading Wildfire** - High-speed fire spread
4. **Category 4 Hurricane** - Major storm system
5. **Major Flooding** - River overflow scenario

### How to Test
```bash
# Trigger simulation via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/agents/simulate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"scenario": "multi_disaster"}'
```

Or use the **Emergency Button** in the frontend UI!
