# Guardian AI - Demo Video Script
## Duration: 3 minutes

---

## SCENE 1: Introduction (0:00 - 0:20)
**[SHOW: Guardian AI Landing Page]**

**NARRATION:**
"What if AI could watch for disasters 24/7 and automatically warn people before it's too late? 

Meet Guardian AI - a multi-agent emergency response system with 12 specialized AI agents working together to save lives.

Built for the MCP Hackathon, this is our emergency hero system that never sleeps."

---

## SCENE 2: The Problem (0:20 - 0:35)
**[SHOW: News footage or disaster images - optional]**
**[THEN: Show landing page statistics section]**

**NARRATION:**
"Every year, thousands die in natural disasters that could have been prevented with early warning. Current systems are slow, fragmented, and require human monitoring.

By the time authorities detect and respond, precious hours are lost.

Guardian AI changes everything."

---

## SCENE 3: Live System Demo - Authentication (0:35 - 0:50)
**[ACTION: Click "Get Started" button]**
**[ACTION: Show Descope authentication briefly]**
**[ACTION: Click "Skip to Demo Mode" for quick access]**

**NARRATION:**
"Let's see it in action. The system uses Descope for secure authentication, protecting all API credentials.

For this demo, we'll use demo mode to show you the full system immediately."

---

## SCENE 4: Dashboard Overview (0:50 - 1:10)
**[SHOW: Main dashboard with world map]**
**[HOVER: Over earthquake markers on map]**

**NARRATION:**
"Here's our command center. Right now, Guardian AI is monitoring real disasters worldwide.

See these markers? Those are actual earthquakes happening right now - we've detected 45 in the last 24 hours from the USGS feed.

The system is completely live and operational."

---

## SCENE 5: Agent Status Panel (1:10 - 1:30)
**[SHOW: Scroll through agent status cards on the right]**
**[POINT: At different agent statuses]**

**NARRATION:**
"On the right, you can see our 12 AI agents, organized into three squads:

- Detection Squad continuously monitors NASA, USGS, and NOAA
- Analysis Squad processes threats and calculates responses  
- Action Squad dispatches alerts and notifications

Notice the green dots? That means they're online and working. Each agent has a specific job and they communicate through our orchestrator."

---

## SCENE 6: Emergency Simulation (1:30 - 2:00)
**[ACTION: Click the red "Emergency Simulation" button]**
**[ACTION: Select "Major Earthquake" scenario]**
**[ACTION: Click "Run Simulation"]**

**NARRATION:**
"Now let's trigger a disaster simulation. I'll select a major earthquake in San Francisco.

Watch what happens - the detection agents immediately identify the threat, analysis agents calculate the impact zone, and action agents dispatch warnings.

All of this happens in under a second, completely autonomous."

**[SHOW: New earthquake marker appears on map]**
**[SHOW: Alert notification pops up]**
**[SHOW: Agent statuses updating]**

---

## SCENE 7: MEGA DISASTER Mode (2:00 - 2:20)
**[ACTION: Click Emergency button again]**
**[ACTION: Select "MEGA DISASTER"]**
**[ACTION: Run simulation]**

**NARRATION:**
"For the ultimate test, let's trigger MEGA DISASTER mode - multiple simultaneous disasters.

Look at the agents go! They're prioritizing threats, calculating evacuation routes, and managing multiple emergencies at once.

This demonstrates how the system scales to handle real-world chaos."

**[SHOW: Multiple disasters appearing on map]**
**[SHOW: Alert feed filling up]**

---

## SCENE 8: Real-Time Features (2:20 - 2:40)
**[SHOW: Statistics panel updating]**
**[SHOW: Alert feed with acknowledge buttons]**
**[CLICK: Acknowledge an alert]**

**NARRATION:**
"Everything updates in real-time through WebSockets. Emergency responders can acknowledge alerts, track statistics, and monitor agent performance.

The system even supports push notifications for critical alerts, ensuring warnings reach people instantly."

---

## SCENE 9: Technical Achievement (2:40 - 2:55)
**[SHOW: Return to main dashboard view]**
**[SLOW PAN: Across the interface]**

**NARRATION:**
"Guardian AI represents a breakthrough in emergency management - the first multi-agent system designed specifically for disaster response.

With zero hardcoded credentials, full Descope integration, and real-time data from NASA, USGS, and NOAA, it's production-ready and scalable globally."

---

## SCENE 10: Call to Action (2:55 - 3:00)
**[SHOW: GitHub repository page in new tab]**
**[RETURN: To Guardian AI dashboard]**

**NARRATION:**
"Guardian AI - your emergency hero system. 

Check out our GitHub repository to see the code and try it yourself.

Together, we can save lives with AI."
