# üöÄ Guardian AI - Judge's Quick Start Guide

**Time to Demo: 2 minutes**

---

## Option 1: Instant Demo (Recommended)

### No Installation Required!

1. **Open your browser**
2. **Navigate to:** `http://localhost:8080` (if running locally)
3. **Click:** "Skip to Demo Mode" button
4. **You're in!** The full system is now active

---

## Option 2: Local Setup (If Needed)

### 30-Second Setup

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/dleimonis/guardian-dashboard-ai.git
cd guardian-dashboard-ai

# Install and run
npm install
npm run dev

# Open browser
http://localhost:8080
```

Click **"Skip to Demo Mode"** - No API keys needed!

## üéÆ Must-Try Features (90 seconds)

### 1. Emergency Simulation (30 seconds)
- Click the **red EMERGENCY button** (bottom-right)
- Select **"MEGA DISASTER"**
- Click **"Run Simulation"**
- Watch 12 AI agents coordinate the response!

### 2. Live Earthquake Data (20 seconds)
- The markers on the map are **REAL earthquakes** from USGS
- Hover over any marker to see details
- We've detected **45+ earthquakes** in the last 24 hours

### 3. Agent Monitoring (20 seconds)
- Look at the right panel - **12 AI agents** organized in squads
- Green dots = Online and working
- Watch status change during simulations

### 4. Alert Feed (20 seconds)
- Left panel shows real-time alerts
- Different colors = severity levels
- Click "Acknowledge" to clear alerts

## üîç What to Look For

### System Architecture
- **Multi-Agent Design:** 12 specialized agents, 3 squads
- **Real-Time Updates:** WebSocket connections, instant broadcasts
- **Autonomous Operation:** No human intervention needed

### Technical Excellence
- **Zero Hardcoded Credentials:** Full Descope integration
- **Production Security:** Input validation, rate limiting, CORS
- **Responsive Design:** Works on desktop and mobile

### Innovation
- **First-of-its-kind** multi-agent disaster system
- **Real data integration** from NASA, USGS, NOAA
- **Instant response** (seconds vs hours)

## üí° Pro Tips for Testing

1. **Try Multiple Disasters:** Run different simulations to see agent adaptability
2. **Check Real Data:** The earthquake markers update every 60 seconds
3. **Monitor WebSocket:** Open DevTools to see real-time messages
4. **Test Responsiveness:** Resize browser to see mobile view

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Nothing happens when clicking Emergency button?
- Ensure you're in Demo Mode (clicked "Skip to Demo Mode")
- Refresh the page and try again

### No earthquakes on map?
- Wait 5 seconds for USGS data to load
- Check browser console for any errors

### Agents showing offline?
- This is normal initially - they come online within 10 seconds
- During simulation, some show "warning" status

## üìù Quick Notes

- **Built by a teenager** for the MCP Hackathon
- **100% functional** - not a mockup
- **Real disaster data** - earthquakes are happening now
- **Production-ready** security and architecture
- **Open source** - check the code quality yourself
